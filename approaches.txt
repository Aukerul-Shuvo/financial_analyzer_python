Financial Analyzer Approaches

1. Data Preparation: Ensure that the transaction data is properly preprocessed.
   This includes converting dates to datetime objects, imputing missing values, categorizing transactions,
   and handling outliers.
2. Threshold Calculation: Define thresholds for high spending and high earning to identify significant
   transactions.
3. Weekly Analysis: Split the data into weekly segments to analyze spending and earning patterns for each
   week of the month.
4. Monthly and Overall Analysis: Calculate monthly and overall totals for both spending and earnings.
5. Comparison of Analyses: Compare the last three analyses to identify trends and changes in financial
   behavior.

1. Analyze the spending and earning behavior for the given dataframe.
    -Sort Data by Date: Ensure the DataFrame is sorted by the date column.
    -Split Month into Weeks: Create a new column week_of_month to represent the week number in the month.
    -Define Thresholds: Calculate the 75th percentile for spending and earning amounts to identify high
     spending and high earning transactions.
    -Weekly Analysis: For each week in the month, calculate the total spent and earned, and identify the
     top three days with the highest spending and earning.
    -Return a dictionary with detailed analysis for each week.

2. Compare three analyses to identify differences in spending and earning patterns.
    -Extract Weeks: Identify the weeks present in the analyses.
    -Compare Spending and Earnings: For each week, compare total spent and earned, as well as high spending
     and earning days, between the three analyses.
    -Return a dictionary with the differences for each week.

3. Calculate historical and current spending/earnings for specified periods.
    -Calculate the historical average spending for the same week in previous months.
    -Calculate the total spending for the current week.
    -Calculate the historical average earnings for the same week in previous months.
    -Calculate the total earnings for the current week.

4. Calculate monthly and overall totals for spending and earnings.
    -Calculate the total spending and earnings for the specified month.
    -Calculate the overall total spending and earnings.
    -Calculate historical monthly totals for spending and earnings.

5. Compare the last three analyses to generate insights.
    -Compare the last three analyses and provides detailed comparisons for spending and earning patterns.

Summary
The financial_analyzer.py module provides a comprehensive set of functions to analyze financial
transactions. It processes the data to create detailed insights into spending and earning behaviors,
calculates historical and current statistics, and compares multiple analyses to identify trends and
changes in financial behavior. By using these functions, we can gain a deeper understanding of financial
patterns and make informed decisions based on the analysis.



Semantic Relation Approaches

1. Load GloVe Model
The model "glove-wiki-gigaword-100" is used, which provides 100-dimensional word vectors.

2. Preprocess Text
The text data is preprocessed to clean and prepare for analysis:

    a. Conversion to Lowercase
    b. Removal of Digits
    c. Removal of Punctuation
    d. Removal of Extra Whitespace
    e. Removal of Stopwords
    f. Elimination of Duplicates

3. Obtain Word Embeddings
For each word in the cleaned text, the corresponding vector representation from the GloVe model is obtained.
If a word is not found in the GloVe model, a zero vector is used as a placeholder.
The result is a dictionary mapping each word to its GloVe vector.

4. Calculate Similarity Matrix
The similarity between words is computed by calculating the cosine similarity between each pair of
word vectors. These similarity scores are stored in a similarity matrix, which provides a comprehensive
view of how similar each word is to every other word in the text.

5. Cluster Words
The K-means clustering algorithm is applied to the word embeddings to group similar words into clusters.
The number of clusters is specified (in this case, 10), and each word is assigned a cluster label.
This results in a dictionary mapping words to their respective clusters.

6. Visualize the Results
For visualization purposes, the high-dimensional word embeddings are reduced to three dimensions using t-SNE.
This reduction allows the word clusters to be visualized in a 3D space.
Two types of visualizations are created:

    a. Heatmap of Similarity Matrix: An interactive heatmap is generated to visualize the similarities
       between words.
    b. 3D Scatter Plot: An interactive 3D scatter plot is created to display the word clusters,
       with words colored according to their cluster labels.

7. Check Similarity Scores
To ensure the accuracy of the similarity scores, specific word pairs are selected, and their cosine
similarity scores are printed. This step involves checking if the similarity scores between these word pairs
are logical and make sense based on their meanings and context. Additionally, the embeddings for these words
can be printed for closer inspection.

Summary
By following these approaches, we can effectively analyze and visualize the semantic relationships between
words in the narrative, providing insights into how words are related based on their contexts.



Synthetic Data Generation Approaches

1. Data Augmentation Techniques

    a. Random Sampling and Variation
Approach: Use the existing transaction data to create new samples by slightly varying the transaction amounts, 
	  dates, or categories.
Example: If a transaction on January 1st, 2023, was for $50 at a grocery store, create new transactions by 
	 adding small random amounts (e.g., Â±$5) or shifting the date by a few days.

    b. Bootstrapping
Approach: Randomly sample transactions with replacement from the existing dataset.
Example: Randomly select transactions from the dataset to create multiple new datasets of the same size, 
	 ensuring variability.

    c. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
Approach: Generate synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples.
Example: If there are few high-value transactions, use SMOTE to generate new high-value transactions based 
	 on existing ones.

    d. Transaction Patterns
Approach: Identify patterns in the existing data, such as monthly or weekly spending habits, and replicate 
	  these patterns to create synthetic data.
Example: If the user spends more on weekends, generate synthetic transactions that follow this pattern.

2. Utilizing ChatGPT for Synthetic Data Generation

    a. Scenario based Generation
Approach: Use ChatGPT to generate transaction data based on various spending scenarios.
Example Prompt: "Generate 10 transactions for a user who frequently dines out during weekends and travels once a month."

Examples: Few-shot prompts can be used to provide examples and generate similar transactions.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Usage: Generate realistic synthetic data through adversarial training.
Examples: Train GANs on existing transactional data to create new, realistic transactions that mimic the original data.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
Usage: Generate synthetic data by learning the distribution of the original data and sampling from this distribution.
Examples: Use VAEs to generate new transactions that follow the same statistical properties as the original dataset.

Conclusion
Generating synthetic transactional data can be effectively achieved using a combination of established techniques and 
generative models. By utilizing scenario-based, template-based, contextual, and few-shot prompts with models like ChatGPT 
and GPT-3, along with advanced generative models like GANs and VAEs, we can create a rich and varied dataset that closely 
resembles real transactional data. This approach ensures that we can continue to perform meaningful analysis and modeling 
even when new data is not immediately available.
